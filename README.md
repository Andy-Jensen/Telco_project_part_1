# Where are my customers going?!?!?!
## A Telco customer churn analysis

# Project:
### Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to analyze the telco_churn dataset and predict why customers are churning. Provide predictions for a group of customers. This will allow "Telco" to make a change and retain customers at a higher rate. 

# Project Goal:
### This project sets out to exercise the data science pipeline on a basic level. This can be applied in personal projects and assignments from employers to help deliver a quality product that delivers some value to the individual, community, or company.

# Initial Hypothesis:
### I have minimally explored this dataset and my initial hypothisis is that churn is due to the price associated with the long term payment plans.

# Project Plan Guides:
### Planning for the project to identify the MVP and deliverables associated with the steps will occur first.
### Data acquisition is partly done. The data has been collected and put into a SQL database. I will still need to querey the data to acquire the necessary information for the project.
### Preperation will be done on the data to ensure that the data is clean and ready for exploration and manipulation.
### After the data is prepared, I will explore the data to isolate a group of customers and identify drivers for that specific group of customers.
### Once exploration is complete, I will generate models and visualize the results of the findings. I will make models, fit them, and predict results. information will be visualized with graphs/charts.
### Delivery will take place in the form of a final presentation. I will present the results infront of my class as though I am giving a presentation to my direct manager and their manager.
